# Hi

#### I'm Aromal early developer of this project  and if you are changing anything keep this in mind all the frontend code and things are complicated so i wrote every each dashboard and  other part of each role in each seperate folders with role name eg: src/components/pm, src/components/admin etc.....


for backend i created a folder named update and  all the new business logics and things are inside that 

the main thing to do is there are some bugs the whole thing has been developed so just take care of the bugs everything will be shared in the ERP group just ask shravan 

also for workers dashboard I have added a web socket for counting workers consumed time remove that logic and just an make it as an normal endpoint that will collect initial time Store it in db then while pausing calculation the difference in the time taken and add that in the consumed_time column in estimation deliverables 


database is neondb for development coz in production we use postgress so
